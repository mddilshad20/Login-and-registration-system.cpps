# Login-and-registration-system.cpps
Iâ€™ll create a Login and Registration System in C++ (Login_registration_system.cpp).  This program will:  Allow new users to register (username + password).  Allow existing users to login.  Store user credentials in a simple text file (so they persist even after the program ends).
